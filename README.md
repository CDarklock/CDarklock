RESOURCE PACKS

Farting Spider, Belching Zombie: the default sounds of zombies
and spiders annoy me, so I replaced them with farts and burps.
This amuses me to no end, because I am nine.

STRUCTURES

Hut: it's the little hut I always build. It's dumb. I just put
it here to create the folder structure, so I can put better things
here in the future.

Origin: A little representation of the positive directions for X, Y,
and Z coordinates. Useful as a sanity check when building with 
commands.

Measure39: This is a basic ruler on a concrete platform with markers
every five and ten blocks. Good for testing pathfinding and detection
ranges.

Ruler10: An extension for the measure30 structure, ten blocks long.

Breeder: An infinite village breeder with off switch. You will have to
add your own water, thanks to how loading structures deals with water
and waterlogged blocks. The two blocks of blue concrete show where the
water goes.
