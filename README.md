RESOURCE PACKS

Farting Spider, Belching Zombie: the default sounds of zombies
and spiders annoy me, so I replaced them with farts and burps.
This amuses me to no end, because I am nine.

STRUCTURES

Hut: it's the little hut I always build. It's dumb. I just put
it here to create the folder structure, so I can put better things
here in the future.
